    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[2] = "Me";

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team1 = players.slice();
    console.log(team1);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team2 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(team2);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    //const team3 = [...players];
    //console.log(team3);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team1[3] = "Me";
    console.log(players);
    team2[3] = "Me";
    console.log(players);
    //team3[3] = "me";
    //console.log(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const me = person;
    me.roll = 80;
    console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person1 = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    const me1 = Object.assign({}, person1, {roll: 80});
    console.log(person1);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const me2 = {...person1};
    me2.roll = 80;
    console.log(person1);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const mee = {
      name: "I",
      roll: {
        major: "DATA",
        minor: "Analyst"
      }
    };

    const man = Object.assign({}, mee);
    man.roll.minor = "Algorithm";
    console.log(mee);

    const mee1 = {
      name: "I",
      roll: {
        major: "DATA",
        minor: "Analyst"
      }
    };

    const man1 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(mee1));
    man1.roll.minor = "Algorithm";
